    Sampler{T}

Generic interface for implementing inference algorithms.
An implementation of an algorithm should include the following:

1. A type specifying the algorithm and its parameters, derived from InferenceAlgorithm
2. A method of `sample` function that produces results of inference, which is where actual inference happens.

DynamicPPL translates models to chunks that call the modelling functions at specified points.
The dispatch is based on the value of a `sampler` variable.
To include a new inference algorithm implements the requirements mentioned above in a separate file,
then include that file at the end of this one.
