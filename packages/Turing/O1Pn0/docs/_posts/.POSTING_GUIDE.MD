# How to write a blog post.

1. Place all blog posts as markdown files in `docs/_posts`.
2. Make sure you use the naming convention "YYYY-MM-DD-some-short-title.md".
3. Include a YAML header in the very first line with the flags `title` and `author`, here's an example:

```yaml
---
title: Turing's Blog
author: Cameron Pfiffer
---
```
