# Tracker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FluxML/Tracker.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FluxML/Tracker.jl)

Flux's old AD, now replaced with [Zygote](https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl).

This package is solid and still in active use, but is no longer heavily maintained; so PRs and issues may go unanswered.
